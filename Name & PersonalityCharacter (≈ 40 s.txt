Hi, my name is Florentin Toupet. As for my personality, I consider myself a hardworking, reliable and adaptable person. I am always willing to learn and try new things. I also enjoy taking on new challenges and learning new skills, and I always strive to do my best in everything I do. I am also a team player and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals.

Work Experience (≈ 1-2 minutes)
I have worked at a few different places over the past couple of years. In the early summer of 2020, I worked as a server at Vroom Café, a food truck in my local area. During the same summer, I also worked as a customer service representative at Tim Hortons. In the summer of 2021, I worked as a carousel operator at La Ronde, an amusement park in Montreal. Most recently, I worked as a busboy and bartender at La Croisée des Chemins since May 2022. Through these experiences, I have developed excellent customer service and communication skills, as well as a strong work ethic and the ability to work well under pressure. I have also learned the importance of being punctual, responsible, and efficient in my work. In terms of volunteering, I have been involved in a number of community service projects through my school and local organizations.


Academic Background (≈ 30-45 seconds)
I am currently in my 4th session at Collège Montmorency, studying computer science and application development. I have completed my high school diploma, and I am now working towards obtaining my college diploma. I have always been interested in technology and the potential it has to solve real-world problems and make a difference in people's lives. I am excited about the opportunities that my studies have provided me to learn and grow in this field.

Pressure & Stress (≈ 1-2 minutes)
I believe that I handle pressure well, and I am able to stay calm and focused in stressful situations. For example, during my time working at La Ronde, there were often long lines and large crowds, which could be challenging to manage. However, I remained patient and attentive to the needs of each guest, and I always tried to maintain a positive attitude, even during the busiest times. In my personal life, I have also had to deal with stressful situations, such as deadlines and difficult exams, but I have learned to manage my time effectively and prioritize my responsibilities in order to meet these challenges.

Linguistic Skills (≈ 30-45 seconds)
I am fluent in French, I'm able to reading, writing, speaking, and listening in Frnech. But in English, my writing ans my speaking skills are not perfect.
I have grown up in a French environment, in France and I already live in French immersion schools. But I enjoy reading and watching movies in both languages to continue improving my skills. Unfortunately, I do not speak any other languages fluently at the moment, but I would love to learn a new language in the future.

Travelling the world (≈ 30-45 seconds)
If I had the opportunity to study in another country for one semester, I would love to go to Tokyo. I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture, from the food to the fashion to the architecture. I think studying in Japan would provide me with a unique cultural experience and the chance to learn from experts in my field. Additionally, Japan is known for its cutting-edge technology and innovation, and I believe that studying there would expose me to new ideas and approaches that I could bring back to
